A Small scale SQL Server Prison Management System
DESCRIPTION:
The system maintains detailed records of legal cases with the CaseFile table, storing information like case ID, court date, verdict, prosecutor in charge, and crime details. Inmates, the central focus of the system, are managed through the Inmate table, capturing personal details, admission and release dates, and crime information. Inmates are assigned to specific rooms and associated with their respective cases.
At the core of the system is the Section table, capturing information about different sections within the prison, such as the total number of rooms and currently occupied rooms. Each room is uniquely identified by a RoomID in Room and is associated with a particular section through a foreign key relationship.
Prison staff, including wardens, correctional officers, and administrators, are recorded in the PrisonStaff table, offering details such as staff ID, name, date of birth, address, joining date, salary, staff type, and work schedule. Disciplinary actions within the prison are documented in the DisciplinaryAction table, highlighting occurrences, dates, times, and descriptions of actions taken against inmates or staff members. The Visitor table and its associated VisitorLogFile table manage records of prison visitors, including details of visitation dates, times, contact information, and the relationship of the visitor with the respective inmate.
The system also keeps track of medical events in the prison infirmary through the PrisonInfirmary and InfirmaryLogFile tables, recording diagnoses, treatments, dates, and times.
